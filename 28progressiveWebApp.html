					A webApp is a web page that allows users to interact with the web page in many ways. They are always are in a browser windows. A native app is that it is meant to work on a native app in an Android or iPhone. PWA addresses the want to have web apps function as close to native as possible without having to be native. For a web app you just need HTML, CSS, and JS, for a native App you need a different programming language. Native apps work by leveraging the files that are present on a user's phone. The apps have the files living on the phone instead of what we do with web apps that serve the apps from a web page. Native apps can also send you push notifications and work offline and you never get a blank screen, as you would if you don't have internet and are browsing the web. Native apps are also found in the App and Play Store, something that you cannot do with a web app, as well as the use of the functionality of a phone such as camera.

					<strong>PWA</strong>
					<br>
					With PWA you can make apps work more like native apps. You can remove the URL bar, you can have an icon in the homescreen of the phone seemlessly. PWAs can work offline, can send push notifications, and can work faster on phones as well. The goal is to make them as similar to native as possible. It is easier to implement than it sounds and the updates are easier as you just need to update your server. With the App store you need to submit the changes and have an audit for the changes. The best part of all is that it runs on every platform available. The goal is better UX, websites. With HTML5 APIs we have more access to hardware, which we can see in <a href="https://whatwebcando.today">What Web Can Do Today</a> allowing us to know what we can do in a PWA regarding Hardware such as local notifications, push messages, audio and video capture, recording media, offline storage, geolocation, etc. 
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					Google created PWA, and the slowest adopter is Apple due to business interests. Google has a massive browser and web share, apple has their closed App store ecosystem which locks you into using what Apple wants you to use and paying them for the App store app. Facebook has React Native, which is a way to build apps for native using react. Since apple is using their proprietary safari browser, they have been slow to adopt these changes out of self interest. This is a cosntant battle that will continue. PWAs will evolve over time and they enhance the UX in an easy way. It is beneficial for anyone that can do it. This is why CRA comes pre-set with PWA capabilities. With a few tweaks we can have a PWA pretty fast, there is no reason not to implement it. Google created Lighthouse which is a plugin that gives us some stats on performance and also shows us how close we are to PWA status.
